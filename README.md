This is a personal resume (Bonam Hitesh Phaneendra) website built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, where all resume data is maintained in a structured JSON-based JavaScript file .

The project dynamically renders resume sections such as About, Skills, Experience, Education, and Projects using JavaScript, making it easy to update content without touching the UI code.

This project was customized and restructured by me based on my requirements, including layout changes, content updates, and design improvements.
